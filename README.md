Online food-delivery platforms are expanding choice and convenience, allowing customers to order from a wide array of restaurants with a single tap of their mobile phone. The online food delivery market is no longer the underdog but has evolved into a champion. Having a food ordering marketplace platform was considered a state-of-the-art innovation in the early 2000s but today the segment has expanded to different demographics across the globe. Thanks to the increasing number of online users and vendors, the delivery providers have a sustainable business model. These businesses have immense opportunities to expand their services to a new geographical area and cater to new demographics.

We have performed following steps while building the model:
•	Exploratory data analysis
•	Feature Engineering
•	Sentiment analysis
•	Applying Models and Evaluating
•	Clustering

Exploratory data analysis:
In this step performed data preparation after that we have cleaned the data. We have performed Univariate, Bivariate, and multivariate analysis and we drove some conclusions.

Featuring Engineering:
		In Feature Engineering we have performed text processing like Lower Casing, Tokenization, Punctuation Mark Removal, Stop Word Removal Stemming, Lemmatization

Sentiment Analysis:
		Sentiment analysis (or opinion mining) is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative, or neutral. To perform sentiment analysis, we use Subjectivity and Polarity score

Applying Models and Evaluating: 
		In this step, we applied different machine learning algorithms to train the model and predict the sentiment. Also, we performed hyperparameter tuning, to find out the best set parameters for the given algorithm. After training the different models with the data it is important to evaluate the model performance using different metrics.

Clustering: 
	In this step we performed clustering. We applied K-Means Clustering and PCA algorithm to get appropriate clusters. After applying the models, we got ‘5’ as optimal cluster size and clustering was done on the basis of the cost.
